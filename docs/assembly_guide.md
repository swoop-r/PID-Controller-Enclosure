# Open-Source Wooden PID Controller Enclosure for E-Nail XLR Systems

## Overview
This project is an **open-source PID controller enclosure** designed specifically for **flex nail e-nail systems**. The enclosure is crafted from **wood** to provide a stylish and natural alternative to traditional metal or plastic cases while maintaining **functionality and durability**. The design aims to support **standard PID controllers and heating coils** commonly used in e-nail setups.

## Features
- **Designed for Flex Coil Systems** – Output port is positioned on the **top** for optimal coil placement.
- **Storage Integration** – Built-in compartments for **14mm nails** and additional accessories.
- **Open-Source Design** – Fully customizable **3D models and CAD files** for personal modifications.
- **Modular and Compatible** – Works with popular **PID controller kits** sourced from trusted manufacturers.
- **Wooden Construction** – Aesthetic, lightweight, and customizable material choice.

## Recommended PID Controller Kits
This enclosure is designed to house a **standard PID controller**, typically used in e-nail setups. Below are some recommended **quality PID kits** that can be sourced and adapted for this project:

1. **Auber Instruments** – Reliable and widely used in e-nail builds.

3. **Mypin TA4 Series** – Budget-friendly PID controllers with decent functionality.
   - Available on Amazon or eBay
4. **Rex C100** – Common in DIY builds, though quality can vary.
   - Available through various electronic suppliers

## Components & Sourcing
To complete the build, the following components are needed:
- **PID Controller** (e.g., Auber, Inkbird, Mypin)
- **SSR (Solid State Relay) & Heatsink**
- **K-Type Thermocouple**
- **Power Input & Output Ports**
- **Flex Coil Connection**
- **Wooden Casing Material** (Plywood, Hardwood, etc.)

## Assembly Instructions
1. **Source Components** – Purchase a PID controller kit and additional parts.
2. **Prepare the Wooden Enclosure** – Use the provided **CAD/3D models** to cut and assemble the case.
3. **Install Electronics** – Secure the PID controller, wiring, SSR, and thermocouple.
4. **Test Functionality** – Ensure proper heating, temperature control, and coil efficiency.
